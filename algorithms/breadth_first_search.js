// Graphs are collections of nodes (also called vertices) 
// and the connections (called edges) between them. 
// Graphs are also known as networks.

// One example of graphs is a social network. 
// The nodes are people and the edges are friendship.


// There are two major types of graphs: directed and undirected. 
// Undirected graphs are graphs without any direction on 
// the edges between nodes. Directed graphs, in contrast, 
// are graphs with a direction in its edges.

// Two common ways to represent a graph are an adjacency 
// list and an adjacency matrix.

// Adjacency matrix graph
// An adjacency list can be represented as a list where the 
// left side is the node and the right side lists all the 
// other nodes it’s connected to.

// An adjacency matrix is a grid of numbers, 
// where each row or column represents a different node 
// in the graph. At the intersection of a row and a column 
// is a number that indicates the relationship. Zeros mean 
// there is no edge or relationship. Ones mean there is a 
// relationship. Numbers higher than one can be used to 
// show different weights.

// Adjacency list (graph) time complexity

// Traversal algorithms are algorithms to traverse or 
// visit nodes in a graph. The main types of traversal 
// algorithms are breadth-first search and depth-first 
// search. One of the uses is to determine how close nodes 
// are to a root node. See how to implement breadth-first 
// search in JavaScript in the video below.
